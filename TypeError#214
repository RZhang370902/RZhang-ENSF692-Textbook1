numpy float.64 is a non-iterable so you can not directly unpack it as you do with the iterables like list or tuple.
However, you can get access it's value directly as- 

import numpy as np

# Create a numpy.float64 object
my_float = np.float64(42.0)

# Access its value
value = my_float.item()
print(value)  # This will print: 42.0

numpy.float64 objects are typically used for numerical computations, and you rarely need to "unpack" them in the same way you would with iterable data structures. 
Instead, you work with them directly as numeric values.
